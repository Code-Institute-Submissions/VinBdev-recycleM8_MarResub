### A resource for people to get information about how and where to recycle
This is a detailed inter active website implemented with the intention of growing social awareness around practical and eco friendly waste management. The long term strategy for this would be to continously add on various locatoins and symbols as the environmental community grows.

The website has been built with a simplistic 3 page layout, the home page has basic information such as an about section and steps explaining how the functionality of the site works. The second page is the real information center of the site and focuses on symbols and map locations. The final page is to get in contact with RecycleM8. I feel very passsionate about continuing to develop this project as my software development

This website was built for people of all ages. We want to encourage users of all ages to the have access and ability to take control of their own environmental impact. Most commonly the users will tend to be people who like me, are renting properties and need to learn as they live in different areas.

The homepage will outline some group information along with a hero image of a earthy plant to remind every vistor why we recycle.

### Business Goal's
* To increase the volume of interest that people have in the environment.
* To allow every citizen the right and ability to contribute for a better cleaner world.
* To allow like minded individuals to get access to informatoin and provide updates to regulations and recycling symbols.
* Eventually it would be ideal to get this up to a commercial level where RecycleM8 is a trusted government advisor that compeltes mandatory reports about the manufacturers of food and waste materials.


### User Goals:
* To provide a simple yet easy flowing website capable for users of varying tech abilities to get easy access to infromation and become a member of environmental community
* To encourage the next generation to be very involved with recycling and that waste management is a standard part of day to day life
* To allow provide accurate and concise information regarding information on recycling symbols as well as the locations of bottle banks, recycling centers and clothes banks in the greater Dublin area.
* To provide the user with contact resources to a higher power of authority/ community based environment.
###  Target Market & User Stories:
#### Target Market:
* Any person with an interest in managing their own waste responsibly
* Any business looking to responsibly get rid of waste and avoid penalties.
* Anyone who has moved into a new area and wants to find out where they can recycle and dispose of their waste

### User Stories:
#### Pake Ferson
Pake Ferson is a 28 year old who has just moved to Dublin from he countryside of Ireland. He is living in an apartment which is situated in a built up area and only give the option to put rubbish in the recycling bin or in general waste. The site is ideal for him as he is new to the area and needs to know where he can dispose of waste.

#### Terry Oldman
Gerald is a 65 year old lady from a rural area in Dublin. Terry has lived in the area for 60+ years and is fascinated by wildlife. Terry's love for wildlife has made her grow a natural affinity for natuire preservatoin and environmentalism. Therefore Terry loves going to the site to provide more informstoin around new waste management procedures.

### UX Design Stages
#### Strategy
My goal for this design was to allow ease of access to information as well as allowing all types of users to get information about various recycling centers, bottle banks and clothes banks.

#### Scope
 For users of the site, I wanted to allow easy navigation across the 3 page structure. This is to enable new members of the community to easily make ther way to the recycle page if they are already guests. Or for new comers to read about how it all works in the about section. They can also click the "Let's get started!" button to bring them to the core content.

#### Structure
The informational design will be very simple and eyecatching, as this page will have both young and old users, I want to appeal to the general audience. The homepage will have a short about section explaining how and why the organisation was founded. This will provide insight but also encourage new memeber to join by realising it was sounded by like minded people.

#### Skeleton
The navigation bar shall allow easy access to any page as well as clear instructions for the non-technical visitors to the site. Each page has a clear descrptive title as I wanted any user to have a clear and easy way to either sign up to become a member or to get the information they need to go to an event without having to sign up in case they are not tech savy.This feature can be seen on many websites and therefore reenforces the functionality of the site.

#### Surface
My aim for this design was to use white and green as the primary constrasting colors to indicate levels of importance to the various sections (navigation bar/ about section/ get started button/ contact form and list of images and descriptions of locations to recycle). This is to give a professional, sleak yet environmental feel to the site..

### Wireframe Mock ups:
Here is my wireframes for the home, recycle and contact pages of the RecycleM8 site.

 [RecycleM8-wireframe.1.pdf](https://github.com/VinBdev/recycleM8/files/7938294/RecycleM8-wireframe.1.pdf)


### Features
#### Home Page
* Initially there is a consitant navigation bar across all 3 pages allowing access to Home, Recycle and Contact page.

* The main hero image has a low opacity to give the content a higher level of attention to the users.

* Below this I have created an about section with some of the most common questions about the organisation as well as some primary background information. This is broken into 4 groups.

* Then I have a smaller instructional section which has been split into 4 steps. The purpose of this section is to explain how the site functions and how to use it. There is also a short congratulatory message as step 1 as by putting your thought about a better world into action can be the hardest step!

* And finally a footer with relevant links to various social media pages of the group.

#### Recycle Page
* Initially there is a consitant navigation bar across all 3 pages allowing access to Home, instruments and Contact page.

* Again the main hero image has a low opacity to give the content a higher level of attention to the users.

* Below this I have picked 9 of hte most common recycling based symbols and given a clear breakdown of the purpose for these symbols.

* Below the symbols and information section, I have built a Google maps API as well as entered 8 marker clusterson the map which are also interactive. These buttons will bring you to recycling centeres, bottle banks and clothes banks on the North, East, South and West side of the city. *This will contain a list of places and images of those centers., 

* *The desriptions will describe what type of facility it is, what it can be used for and a button to bring you to the place on the map.

* And finally a footer with relevant links to various social media pages of the group.

#### Contacts Page
* Initially there is a consitant navigation bar across all 3 pages allowing access to Home, instruments and Contact page.

* Again the main hero image has a low opacity to give the content a higher level of attention to the users.

* In the centre of the screen I have created a nice contact form just below a header encouraging users to get in touch.

* And finally a footer with relevant links to various social media pages of the group.

#### Features to Add in Future
* Adding a CAPTCHA to the contact form page would reduce volume of spam messages coming into the group and only allow for genuinely interest people to get in touch.
* Cookie and GDPR compliance page to allow users to have more control of how their data will be used.
* It would be great to set up an FAQ page for this site as with older members of the group their can tend to be regular recurring questions.
* Ideally I would love to add a scan barcode sectoin allowing users to scan physical items and have an API pull in the information about the symbol and materials of the item.
* Also it would be great to add user functionality so that a user can make an account and encourage others to actively manage their own waste materials.

* This project was created using the Cloud based IDE Gitpod, I continuously added, committed and pushed my code to Github. This was instructed by Code Institute lessons and by my mentor. In order to deploy my website to github I followed the below steps:

* I began by logging into my Github account
* Then I click repositories section if not already in the top used repositories and click on the link recycleM8
* Once I had opened this file, I then selected the settings option
* At this stage I scrolled down until you saw the Github pages section - this brought me to the dedicated page to deploying your site
* I then clicked a drop-down menu item which was labelled None and selected the Master branch
* The website automatically deployed once I selected the master branch
* I then scrolled back down to the section of Github pages to get the link for the deployed site.
* Scroll back down to the GitHub Pages section to retrieve the link to the deployed website.
github have also now created their own page for the deployment process as well. Visit Live Site Here


### Credits
#### The Full Stack programme lessons on UX design and Bootstrap.
* I reviewed the previous lessons of the course while typing out the core HTML and CSS structure of this project. I then used the Bootstrap framework to enable to site responsiveness for mobile/tablet and desktop users.

#### LMS contnet on Google maps & Email.js
* For these sectoins I reflected back on the course to the lessons around functions, event listenters, setting up an api and working with maps/ email.js

#### Youtube tutorials on google maps api
* The google maps team has their own youtube channel containing lots of videos and documentation to support development and marker clusters. https://www.youtube.com/c/GoogleMapsPlatform/videos

#### Stack Overflow
* Stack overflow was a great resource while using this project and navigating through javascript territory it allowed me to relate other developers problems to my own and then to reflect back on my own work using the feedback form other developers.

#### Content
* All content in the about me section was written by me and is fictoinally based on a non-profit company called RecycleM8.
* The content written in the recycle container section below the map has also been written by me as I have had some experience using the se facilities. I also cheked out osme * google reviews and the websites of the actual recycling companies.
* The images were all free resources taken from Pexels and Unsplash. At the advice of my mentor I downloaded these images and compressed them to ensure high quality imagery throughout the site.

#### Media
* The images were taken from Pexels and Unsplash

* https://www.pexels.com/
* https://unsplash.com/
* All images were downloaded to ensure the consistency of UX in case they are removed from the web.

### Acknowledgements
* I was inspired to create this site after being unsure as to where I can go to recycle bottles and waste materials. Having lived in many areas across Dublin I've always wanted to have access to some common facilites in each side of the city.
* I've also been an active environmentalist in y earlier years however with Covid and Lockdown I have not done any charity work in a very long time so this application came off the back of some think tank sessions about how to reduce waste and increase awareness.
* I would often be curious as to what was recylable. I enjoy cooking a lot and always wash the materias with hot soapy water, then leave to rinse and recycle the waste the following day. But on several occasions I was unsure as to what I could actually recycle, so this site has already solved my own problem sand I hope it can one day help others.
* I also received various links and resources from my mentor Brian Macharia

### Disclaimer
* This project is for educational purposes only.

### The Future of RecycleM8
* Once I have completed the Full Stack Software Development programme I would like to come back to this project and add on the following two features.

* A scannable barcode section. Ideally it would be great to have the ability to be in a shop and to scan an item in order to determine whether this is fully recyclable or not. This would make it much easier for the governing bodies that oversee the primary food and good producers are using recyclable goods. It would also empower individuals to start taking control of their own waste management.
* The second featire would be to add a user profile which would allow you to track and share what items you had recyclced that day/ week/ month as by doing this and even sharing your weekly goals it would actively encourage others to get involved with proper waste management.
* If waste management was at this level of control and sustainability we would actively reduce the volumes of general waste each year as well as the various landfills across the planet.
